## BVSF Model

Simulation code for studying evolutionary dynamics of fungal symbionts in ambrosia beetles.
The model integrates Lotka–Volterra competition, genetic drift under bottlenecks, and selection during gallery growth to evaluate fixation, coexistence, and community outcomes.

## Main Files

BVSF_v6.py — Generates all simulation figures (LV dynamics, drift–selection, multi-species, ESS).

reliability_tests_v5.py — Numerical and reproducibility validation.

## Run

python BVSF_v6.py
